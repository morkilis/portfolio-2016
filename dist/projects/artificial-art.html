Once designs become locked in, it becomes challenging to break free from the established modes of thinking they have fostered.</p><p>In the case of the web platform Mechanical Turk, people underpay other people to do creatively stagnating, mechanical work online. The tasks posted on the site usually range from image tagging to information collection and data verification, and often pay between $1-$5 per task. The site's promotion of standardized thinking about human intelligence and labor actively demands that people reduce their existence to automated, faceless selves.</p><p>Artificial Art intervenes within Amazon’s already-established platform and takes advantage of one of the service’s most critical workarounds: endorsing cheap human workers from across the globe to execute tasks that computers should be able to do but can’t yet — hence MTurk's quirky tagline: Artificial Artificial Intelligence. The project is divided into three parts: the Human Intelligence Task Generator, the catalog, and the exhibition, all of which explore the work created by the anonymous workers commissioned via Mechanical Turk.</p><!--Yet this collection of work is unusual; each drawing reflects a worker’s response to an automated task-generator, an algorithm programmed to construct random drawing instructions for every worker to carry out. In this case, the logic behind the instructions is artificial, however the workers’ results celebrate what it means to be human.
Artificial Art presents traces of online labor, while working within the confines of Mechanical Turk’s privacy policy and terms of use. The featured “artists” hold a unique Worker ID but remain anonymous, unless they wish to reveal their identity. Through this absurd exhibition their work becomes an elevated artifact and is offered for sale through a silent auction which will begin at 8pm. Viewers are encouraged to participate in the public auction and bid an amount for drawings they wish to own.

I wanted to flip the roles MTurk suggests: instead of being one of the people who commission other people to carry out uninspiring robotic tasks, I decided to build an algoithm that will generate thousands of randomized drawing instructions for every worker to work on. In this case, the logic behind the instructions is artificial, automatic, however the workers’ results celebrate what it means to be human.</p><p>The HIT Generator<span>*</span> is written in javacript and is presented as a website. When I posted my task to Mechanical Turk's interface, I simply asked workers to follow the link that leads to the HIT Generator and send me their drawing results along with a copy of their given instructions. Since the HIT Generator generate different instructions with every refresh of the page, I wanted to have a copy of the instructions that workers received and carried out. So in order to make this process easier for my workers I included a feature on the website that allows every visitor to get a copy of the instructions as a png image.</p><p class="unindent"><span>*</span>In Mechanical Turk, every task is referred to as a<i>HIT</i> - Human Intelligence Task.<br>I decided to use MTurk's terminology and called my algorithm website the HIT Generator.</p></div></article><article><div class="eight-columns center"><h3>The Catalog</h3><p>The second part of the project is a book documenting all of the work sent to me by my workers - drawings which were created in response to the HIT Generator.</p></div><div class="six-columns"><figure><img src="/images/AAI-catalog3.jpg"></figure></div><div class="six-columns clear"><figure><img src="/images/AAI-catalog2.jpg"></figure></div><div class="four-columns"><figure><img src="/images/AAI-catalog1.jpg"></figure></div><div class="four-columns"><figure><img src="/images/AAI-catalog5.jpg"></figure></div><div class="four-columns clear"><figure><img src="/images/AAI-catalog4.jpg"></figure></div><div class="six-columns"><figure><img src="/images/AAI1.jpg"></figure></div><div class="five-columns shift-one"><h3>Cover & jacket</h3><p>For the cover, I placed my collected instructions in a dense frid, front and back.

I love this typeface because it’s super legible and its beautiful curves and serifs make it approachable and warm. The strange pairing with any automated content brings back the discussion about artificial humanness.</p><p>I continued with this line of thinking (flipping the roles of artificial and artificial-artificial, or to avoid this confusion: human and machine), and decided to set the rest of the text, which was not automatically generated,  in a san-serif. I chose Basis Grotesque Bold because of its rigidity — the opposite from Lora — and the sense of stiffness it gives readers.</p></div><div class="six-columns shift-one"><figure><h3 class="AAI-type lora">Hello world</h3><figcaption>Lora Normal (Google Font)</figcaption></figure><figure><h3 class="AAI-type basis">Hey there</h3><figcaption>Basis Grotwsque Bold (Colophon)</figcaption></figure></div></article><article><div class="six-columns"><figure><img src="/images/AAI_1200px.gif"></figure></div><div class="five-columns shift-one"><h3>Exhibition & live auction</h3><p>This part is still in development, and in case anyone is actually reading this — you are invited to take part in the last part of my project: On April 3rd I will be exhibiting the work done by my anonymous workers at Rabbithole Projects (33 Washington St. Brooklyn, NY) and selling it at a live auction at the end of the event.</p><div><h3>Microsite</h3><p>The first step I took before starting to promote the exhibtion was to simplify the name of my progect: I shortened "Artificial Artificial Inteligence" to “Artificial Art”, and then I designed and programmed a microsite to promote the event.
